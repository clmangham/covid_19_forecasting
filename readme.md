# Forcasting COVID 19

The goal of this project is to forecast the incidence of COVID-19 cases. Data curated by [JHU CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/). This project is an extension of UMich Masters of Applied Data Science: Health Analytics Coursework.

## Content

  1. Inspect correlations between demographic factors and COVID-19 prevelance

  2. Implement LSTM model for COVID-19 forecasting and evaluate on state and county-level data

  3. Visualize the performance of model trained on county-level data

## Factors that correleate with COVID-19

Smoking is the factor most positvely corrleated with covid cases, followed by poor health and obesity. Conversely, median household income negatively correlates with covid.

## Map of Cases
We can plot the ratio of cases in comparision to smokers:

## LSTM model for COVID-19 forecasting

We implement elements of the model explained in the paper: [A spatiotemporal machine learning approach to forecasting
COVID-19 incidence at the county level in the United States](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.12094.pdf). Unlike the paper we will not be implementing an ensemble but only one model.

The prediction intereval is widest around November 2020.
